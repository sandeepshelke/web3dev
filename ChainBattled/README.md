# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn add hardhat
npm install -D @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle dotenv
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```

Deployed smart contract with struct 0x87e48C755A404726B99558b355CDD275f4b80430
